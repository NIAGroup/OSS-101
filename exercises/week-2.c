 * Exercises:
 *	1. Create a function that swaps the values of two integers.
 *
 *	2. Create your own version of the strlen function using
 *	   only pointer arithmetic. You may use the strlen man
 *	   page for a description of the function:
 *	   http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strlen.3.html
 *
 *	3. Write a small program that declares and initializes a
 *	   char and a pointer to this char. Your program should
 *	   print out the value, address, and size of each of the
 *	   two variables.
