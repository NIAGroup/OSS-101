/*
 * Exercises:
 *	1. Create your own version of the memcpy function using
 *	   only pointer arithmetic. You may use the memcpy man
 *	   page for a description of the function [1].
 *
 *	2. Use the qsort [2] function to sort an array of integers
 *	   in ascending or descending order by creating two functions
 *	   that can be used as the last argument to qsort.
 *
 *	3. Implement a singly linked list [3] along with functions
 *	   to add an element to the end of the list, delete an element,
 *	   and traverse a list and print its elements.
